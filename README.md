# Steel Plant Internship Project

This is a full-stack web application built as part of my summer internship at a steel plant. The project uses Java (Spring Boot), HTML/CSS/JS, and two MySQL databases.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `frontend/` - HTML, CSS, JS files
- `backend/` - Node.js and Express.js
- `database1.sql` - First database
- `database2.sql` - Second database

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Node.js and Express.js
- MySQL (2 Databases)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- XAMPP (for local database server)

## 🗃️ Database Details

### Database 1: `employee_db`
Used for storing employee records and login credentials.

### Database 2: `suggestions_db`
Stores the suggestions from the employees.

> ⚠️ Make sure both databases are imported in your local MySQL using phpMyAdmin or `mysql` CLI before running the project.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Start XAMPP and ensure MySQL is running.
2. Import both `employee_db.sql` and `suggestion_db.sql` into MySQL.
3. Configure database credentials in `application.properties`.
4. Run the Spring Boot application.
5. Open the `index.html` login page and test the system.
